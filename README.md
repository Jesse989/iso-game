# Phaser 3 Isometric RPG

A Phaser 3 based isometric role playing game.
Will either be fantasy or science fiction, still need to decide
and start looking for sprites.

Mostly working on the combat and movement mechanics first.
would like to create a very short scenario to test mechanics,
and work on a full story and design after that.

### Requirements

We need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to install and run scripts.

Run next commands in your terminal:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies and launch browser with examples.|
| `npm start` | Launch browser to show the examples. <br> Press `Ctrl + c` to kill **http-server** process. |
